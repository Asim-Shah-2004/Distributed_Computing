                      CLOCK SYNCHRONIZATION EMERGENCY
========================================================================

Monocarp, Polycarp, and Pak Chenak are three students frantically 
working to complete their major project. Unfortunately, they've discovered 
their computers are showing different times, causing confusion about when 
assignments are actually due.

"We have no idea when to submit our work!" Monocarp complained during 
their emergency video call. "My computer says it's 3:15, but Polycarp's 
shows 3:22, and Pak Chenak's is somehow 20 minutes behind both of us!"

With the submission deadline approaching and no technical expertise among 
them, they've reached out to you for help. They need a way to synchronize 
their clocks to ensure they submit their work on time and avoid penalties.
