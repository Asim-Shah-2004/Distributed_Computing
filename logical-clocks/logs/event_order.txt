  Vector Clock: [1, 2, 0]
  Description: Sent: DATABASE_UPDATE

Event 4: Node 2 - RECEIVE from Node 1
  Vector Clock: [1, 2, 1]
  Description: Received: DATABASE_UPDATE

Event 5: Node 2 - SEND to Node 0
  Vector Clock: [1, 2, 2]
  Description: Sent: CACHE_REFRESH

Event 6: Node 0 - RECEIVE from Node 2
  Vector Clock: [2, 2, 2]
  Description: Received: CACHE_REFRESH

Event 7: Node 0 - INTERNAL
  Vector Clock: [3, 2, 2]
  Description: Internal event: CACHE_REFRESH
