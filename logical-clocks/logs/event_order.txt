  Description: Received: DATABASE_UPDATE

Event 3: Node 0 - SEND to Node 1
  Vector Clock: [1, 0, 0]
  Description: Sent: CACHE_REFRESH

Event 4: Node 1 - RECEIVE from Node 0
  Vector Clock: [1, 2, 1]
  Description: Received: CACHE_REFRESH

Event 5: Node 1 - SEND to Node 0
  Vector Clock: [1, 3, 1]
  Description: Sent: TRANSACTION

Event 6: Node 0 - RECEIVE from Node 1
  Vector Clock: [2, 3, 1]
  Description: Received: TRANSACTION

Event 7: Node 1 - INTERNAL
  Vector Clock: [1, 4, 1]
  Description: Internal event: TRANSACTION
