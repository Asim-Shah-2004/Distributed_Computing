## Algorithm Description


The Bully Algorithm works as follows:
1. A node detects that the coordinator is not responding.
2. It sends an ELECTION message to all nodes with higher IDs.
3. If no response is received within a timeout, the node becomes the coordinator and sends COORDINATOR messages.
4. If a higher ID node receives an ELECTION message, it sends an OK response and starts its own election.
5. The highest ID node eventually becomes the coordinator.

The Ring Algorithm works as follows:
1. Nodes are arranged in a logical ring (Node 0 -> Node 1 -> ... -> Node N-1 -> Node 0).
2. When a node detects leader failure, it initiates an election by sending an ELECTION message with its ID to the next node.
3. Each node adds its ID to the list and forwards the message.
4. When the message completes the ring, the node with the highest ID becomes the coordinator.
5. The coordinator announcement is then propagated around the ring.
