## Introduction

Distributed computing is the backbone of modern internet services, cloud computing, and large-scale data processing systems. This repository provides hands-on implementations of the core concepts that power these systems, from basic communication mechanisms to complex distributed algorithms.

## Experiments

### RPC (Remote Procedure Calls)

Remote Procedure Calls enable function execution across machine boundaries, creating the illusion of local execution while handling the complexities of network communication.

#### Implementation Details:
- **gRPC**: Protocol buffer-based high-performance RPC framework with strong typing and code generation
- **XML-RPC**: Lightweight RPC using XML for encoding
- **Pyro**: Python Remote Objects for seamless distributed object communication
